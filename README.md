# UFO_Sightings_Challenge

## Overview
Creating a website for Diana that can pull information from the data.js file and display that information on a webpage that we created for her. Where the website allows the user to filter out the data to find certain UFO sightings.

## Results

1. First we have our blank form. Here we can search by the date, city, state, country, shape. It currently shows examples of what the user needs to enter and how it should be inputted.

2. The second image shows a search where we searched in city for Loveland. To clear the search and show the full table again, we just need to empty the search fields and search.

Here we show what happens when multiple fields are filled for the search form.

## Summary

* One drawback is the person needs to know the specific attribute(s) they are looking for and have to make sure it exactly matches what's in the table.
* A recommendation would be to add a drop down field for each field where the user can select the attribute they are searching for instead of having to write it out themselves.
* Another addition that could be made is allowing someone else add a UFO sighting.
